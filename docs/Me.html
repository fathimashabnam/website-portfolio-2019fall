        <p> That is a great question. Before I answer though, we should clarify what
          you mean... </p>
        <p> Why should <strong> you </strong> listen to me? Because you're an Engineering student,
          presumably a Freshman, and since you're here, you're looking for advice to cope with
          this challenge. I will propose a counter-question... "Why not?" </p>
        <p> Why should you listen to <strong> me</strong>? Fair question. After all, I am just
          another person on the internet supposedly claiming to have all the answers.
          I'll let you in on a secret: I don't. Now that that's out of the way, I do know what
          I am talking about because I have been through it and made my mistakes. My freshman year was
          not great, but during my sophomore year, I got term GPAs of 3.75 and 3.91. That drastic
          turnaround is because I realized some key aspects that I am willing to share... for free.
          I am also an international student peer mentor and have been a teaching assistant for two years now so I
          also have experience sharing advice. </p>

          <p> To top it all off, “Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.” ~ Otto von Bismarck.

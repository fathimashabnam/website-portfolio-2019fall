        <p> Time... ah, how we wish we had more when we we're cramming for an exam the night before, but wish it
          passed quicker in class.
        </p>
        <p> Truth of the matter is that we all have <strong> the same amount </strong> - 24 hours in a day.
          So, how do some people manage this so well? What are their secrets?
        </p>

        <p> It's all about ...  <strong> <u> priorities </u> </strong>. That's right folks- you heard it here. Apparently,
          reading a storybook until 4am on a weeknight because you're hooked with the storyline somehow affects your ability to
          prepare for an upcoming quiz (wow, where could I have gotten such a relatable example...) This does not mean to always prioritize coursework-
          your mental wellbeing should take precedence, but applying the 80/20 rule implies that
          80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. This means knowing where that 20% must be targetted.
        </p>

        <p> A good engineering student's schedule consists of a solid (uninterupted) block of study (outside of classes) daily, and
          then time dedicated to others important aspects of life- socializing responsibly, dedicating time for other interests/goals,
          and involving in extracurriculars. Here's a mind twist that has proven true in my
          undergrad career- the more busy I am, the more productive I am. You may think, "duhh. I mean if you are busy, you are obviously
          getting more stuff done." That's not exactly what I'm getting at. The more I fill up my schedule (while keeping it realistic),
          the more I am able to accomplish. If I preemptively plan out my day to only have 2 things on my to-do list, I spent the entire day lethargically
          dragging my tasks. However, in a busy schedule, the strict deadlines push me to be super productive.
        </p>

        <p> Honestly, time management is something I am continuing to work on, and I doubt you will master it at the end of your freshman year.
          But what I can tell you is your struggle with it now will teach you valuable tools to carry with through life. The value of a good higher education
          is that you learn tools to use for the rest of your life, and managing time is something I see a lot of adults struggle with.
          Let your current lessons pave a smooth path for your future.

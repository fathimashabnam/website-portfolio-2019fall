        <p> Time... ah, how we wish we had more when we we're cramming for an exam the night before, but wish it
          passed quicker in class.
        </p>
        <p> Truth of the matter is that we all have <strong> the same amount </strong> - 24 hours in a day.
          So, how do some people manage this so well? What are their secrets?
        </p>

        <p> Below are two clocks- one portrays the 12-hour timespan (midday to midnight) of a good engineering student
          and the other of one who is barely scraping by in their class. Click on the different numbers to discover how
          their days differ.
        </p>

        <p> It's all about ...  <strong> <u> priorities </u> </strong>. That's right folks- you heard it here. Apparently,
          reading a storybook until 4am on a weeknight because you're hooked with the storyline, somehow affects your ability to
          prepare for an upcoming quiz (example taken from life experience). That doesn't mean always prioritize classes-
          you're mental wellbeing should take precedence sometimes, but applying the 80-20 rule implies that
          80% of your efforts must be toward your goal (in this case, to do well in classes) in order to achieve success.

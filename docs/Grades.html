          Let's jump into it. This is the main source of anxiety and in some cases,
          determinant of worth as a student. Let's put something into perspective:
          everything needs to be balanced. You can't adopt a <em> "C's get degrees" </em> or a
          <em> "every point matters" </em>attitude and expect Engineering to go smoothly.
        </p>

        <p align="right" style="color:#c3979f;"> "Yeah, yeah, blah blah blah. I know all that, just get to the
          part where you tell me how to do well!" </p>

        <h2 align="center"> So how does one achieve a high GPA?  </h2>

        <p> Here's a list of things you can start with: </p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> <strong> <font color="#514f70"> Know your learning style. </font> </strong> </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
            There are four types of learners: visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic.
            This means that one type of learning style will not be as effective for one student as it
            may be for another student. I am a visual and auditory learner so I watch a lot of videos and
            make up images in my head to learn
            material. Knowing your most effective style will be extremely valuable for you to retain
            knowledge. <a href="https://blog.prezi.com/the-four-different-types-of-learners-and-what-they-mean-to-your-presentations-infographic/" target="_blank">Here is a list that may make it easier for you to apply this information.
            </a> </p>
          </div>
          <p></p>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> <strong><font color="#e4946b"> Attend and be active in class. </font> </strong> </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p> <em> I cannot stress this enough.</em> At 7:30am, the last thing you
              want to do is get out of your comfortable, warm, and soft bed. I get it. I truly do. My
              relationship with my bed is the strongest one I have ever had, and probably will ever have (shameless repetition of joke from the relationship section).
              However, the sad fact is that if you do not attend class, you are missing very valuable information
              you are paying thousands of dollars for. In general, professors (despite what students like to believe) actually
              want to teach students what they know. The last thing they want to see is a room full of empty seats.
            </p>
            <p> My experience dictates that when a student participates in class discussion, said student retains information taught better.
              Plus, asking questions in class helps clarify your and your classmates' questions. Also, in a 200-person classroom, asking questions actually helps professors
              to notice you, which is a good thing (cue next point).
            </p>
            <p> Bonus tip: try push skipping class as much as you can. Once you skip once, it becomes easier to continue. </p>
          </div>
          <p></p>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"> <strong><font color="#848c7e"> Go to office hours </font> </strong> </button>
            <div class="content">
              <p> Yes, I am asking you to undergo the anxiety of meeting your professor one-on-one and possibly make a fool out of
                yourself to a well-respected, educated and noble professor.
              </p>
              <p> If you're anything like I was during my freshman year, professors scared me. They could be the nicest people, and
                even give out candy in class (fun fact, my graduate level professor actually brings snacks for us every class), but the
                thought of embarrasing myself in front of faculty kept me far from their office. Here's my piece of advice for you:
                if you make a joke and laugh at yourself (as long as you're <u> not </u> rude), it'll make you more memorable. My closest
                student-professor relationships have formed after some mildly "embarrasing" moment, and all of the successful ones have
                happened because I overcame my anxiety and went to their office hours.
              </p>
              <p> Here's something I wasn't told before: you don't need to have a great question to go to office hours!
              Depending on the type of office hours the professor holds (which you will find out after going at least once), you may be able to
              just listen to other students' questions (like a big group study- just with the professor to steer you in the correct direction).
              </p>
              <p> Once you attend one office hour session, you will realize just how few students go to office hours.
                Professors allocate time in their busy schedules to only answering students' questions outside of class... and so many students
                do not take advantage of this free resource.

                  I apologize. This is such a big topic that it deserves an entire page to it. For now, here's the cliffnotes version:

          Let's jump into it. This is the main source of anxiety and in some cases,
          determinant of worth as a student. Let's put something into perspective:
          everything needs to be balanced. You can't adopt a <em> "C's get degrees" </em> or a
          <em> "every point matters" </em>attitude and expect Engineering to go smoothly.
        </p>

        <p class="firstpara"> "Yeah, yeah, blah blah blah. I know all that, just get to the
          part where you tell me how to do well!" </p>

        <h2 class="secondsub"> So how does one achieve a high GPA?  </h2>

        <p> Here's a list of things you can start with: </p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Know your learning style. </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
            There is some controversy concerning whether learning styles are an innate phenomenon or just
            a hype that may do some good. To top it off, there is also no concensus on how many learning
            styles exist in the first place. So you may wonder why I am starting with this... </p>
            <p>
            Here's the good news: there is no controversy on forming good habits and sticking with what
            works. What I mean by "know your learning style" is to know what works for you. Despite
            the fact that learning styles may not be a real thing (since most people have a combination
            and a style is a result of what has been practiced), if in the past you associate yourself as a
            visual, auditory, reading/writing or kinesthetic learner, continue to learn with a method that works
            for <em>you</em>.</p>
            <p>
            The details matter too. During my Freshman year, I learned that we can improve our "mood" to study
            and even memory by associating certain physical cues to studying. An example would be turning on a desk lamp to do focused
            studying, and turning it off once you're done can actually help you focus in the future. I'm sure
            there is a scientific term for this, but I call it "Pavloving myself".
            </p>
          </div>
          <p></p>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Attend and be active in class. </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p> <em> I cannot stress this enough.</em> At 7:30am, the last thing you
              want to do is get out of your comfortable bed. I get it. I truly do. My
              relationship with my bed is a strong one (my mother can attest to this).
              However, the sad fact is that if you do not attend class, you are missing very valuable information that
              you are literally paying thousands of dollars for. In general, professors (despite what students like to believe) actually
              want to teach students what they know. The last thing they want to see is a room full of empty seats.
            </p>
            <p> My experience dictates that when a student participates in class discussion, said student retains information taught better.
              Plus, asking questions in class helps clarify your and your classmates' questions. Also, in a 200-person classroom, asking questions actually helps professors
              to notice you, which is a good thing (cue next point).
            </p>
            <p> Bonus tip: try push skipping class towards the end of the semester as much as you can. Once you skip once, you may find yourself caught in a viscous downward spiral. </p>
          </div>
          <p></p>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Go to office hours </button>
            <div class="content">
              <p> Yes, I am asking you to undergo the anxiety of meeting your professor one-on-one and possibly making a fool out of
                yourself to a well-respected, educated and noble professor.
              </p>
              <p> If you're anything like I was during my freshman year, professors scared me. They could be the nicest people, and
                even give out candy in class (fun fact, my graduate level professor actually brings snacks for us every class), but the
                thought of embarrasing myself in front of honorable faculty kept me far from their office. Here's my piece of advice for you:
                if you make a joke and laugh at yourself (as long as you're <u> not </u> rude), it'll make you more memorable. My closest
                student-professor relationships have formed after some mildly "embarrasing" moment, and all of the successful ones have
                happened because I overcame my anxiety and went to their office hours.
              </p>
              <p> Here's something I wasn't told before: you don't need to have a great question to go to office hours!
              Depending on the type of office hours the professor holds (which you will find out after going at least once), you may be able to
              just listen to other students' questions (like a big group study- just with the professor to steer you in the correct direction).
              </p>
              <p> Once you attend one office hour session, you will realize just how few students go to office hours.
                Professors allocate time in their busy schedules to only answering students' questions outside of class... and so many students
                do not take advantage of this free resource.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Practice, practice, practice </button>
              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  You're an Engineering student, so I am going to presume you've taken maths classes.
                  From experience, you probably know that practice is <strong> key</strong>, and yet somehow when students come into undergrad
                  practice takes a backseat. I understand that there is a lot to do- each chapter consisting of at least 50 pages. Here's the wow factor:
                  practice trumps readings (in most subjects). Physics, maths and even for psychiology class, doing problems and solving through themselves
                  will help you retain the knowledge much better. This isn't just me saying this, it's actual research.
                </p>

              <div class="content">
                <p>
                  If you think you're going to succeed through Engineering alone, oh boi, you're wrong. If you end up being right, I am both amazed
                  and worried for you.
                </p>
                <p> A great team will make all the difference in your engineering classes. You need to find friends who will motivate, encourage you, and
                  be self-motivated to perfom well. These networks you make through school will help you in many, many ways. That being said, a distracting and unmotivating team can be
                  disasterous, so choose your friends and teammates carefully.

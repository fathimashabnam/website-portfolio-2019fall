        <h2 align="center"> Is Engineering the right major for me? </h2>
        <p> We are a generation who wants our lives to have "purpose" and our work to be "impactful". It's a wonderful
          goal to have, but not entirely a S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) one to have.
          The problem with adopting this phenomenon as a mantra is that we, as a generation used to instant-gratification, easily
          lose interest in things that do not seem to have an immediate impact or positive result.
        </p>
        <p> I say this here with good reason. In the U.S.A. the undergraduate degree is extremely flexible (some would agrue,
          too much so). One outcome of this is that students often find themselves conflicted whether they chose the
          "right path" or not.
        </p>
        <p> "Follow your passion" - a seemingly harmless piece of advice that can caused havok to our mental wellbeing. How in the world
          are we supposed to find that? Especially so in engineering, where the majority of the first year education involves solving
          double integrals and determining whether allylic carbanions are more stable than methyl carbanions.
        </p>
        <p> My piece of advice to you is to temporarily throw the question of passion in the trashbin during your freshman year. It is extremely rare
          for any Engineer to claim that he or she <strong> loves </strong> engineering. It just isn't common. You may love aspects of the
          major, but until you start working or applying the knowledge you have in some manner, you will probably despise it to an extent. Unlike a doctor,
           our application of knowledge as impactful isn't as tangigle. Your contributation may be small at first, but without the small parts
           working well, our inventions would soom fall apart. This delay in satisfaction is why so many students drop out- is the effort worth it in the end? Only you can decide.
           But don't take a rash decision in the middle of the worst part of it. Freshman year is supposed to weed out students who are unwilling to put in a little effort.
           Wait it out and decide in your second year of school, as it is much harder to get in than it is to get out.
